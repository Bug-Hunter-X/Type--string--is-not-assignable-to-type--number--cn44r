# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error where a type mismatch occurs.  The function `add` expects two numbers, but a string is passed. This results in a compile-time error, preventing the code from running.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix the issue by using type guards or type assertions.
